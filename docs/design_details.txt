STCg12

Introduction:
The STCg12 (Statistical Calculator from Group 12) is a calculator program oriented to very basic statistical computations.
The program specifically computes various statistical interpretations, of a specific population as specified by the program user.

The various statistical data computed by our program include:
- Count
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Min value
- Max value
- Standard deviation
- Variance

Our program collects population data from the user, then computes the 8 basic statistical dimensions of a population and displays the 
output (on supported languages).

Technical:
The program has implementations in 3 languages:
- C 17
- Aarch32
- 8086 ISA

Platforms:
The C17 implementation is a robust codebase that can be compiled to any target platform via a suitable compiler.

The 8086 ISA implementation is tailored for the Intel 8086 microprocessor.

The Aarch32 implementation is tailored for the ARM7 microprocessor.
